# Getting and Cleaning Data - Week 4 Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

The files in this repo are:

1) tidy_data.txt : a tidy data set as described below. 

2) run_analysis.R: the script for performing the analysis.

3) CodeBook.md: a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work  performed to clean up the data. 

## Data:
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

## R script  steps to tidy the data set
Load the data.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
